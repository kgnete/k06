Our code should work on both Python versions 2.7 and above as well as Python 3.3 and above. If you do not have Python installed, you need to do that. I'd recommend getting Python 3 for this software, though both families (2.7+ and 3+ will work). Go to the Python Download Page, find the appropriate install version for your computer, follow the directions, and you should be good.\n",

If you download either the newest version of Python 2 (after v 2.7.9) and any version of Python3 starting with Python3.4 come with pip preinstalled. To make sure you have pip if you're using the Python 2 family, run:\n",
