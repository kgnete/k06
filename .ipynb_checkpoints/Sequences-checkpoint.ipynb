    "For us, sequences can be considered to be a set of values indexed by an integer. Such sequences are useful for representing discrete-time data in variety of applications, including digital audio, stock prices, bank balances, and control applications. For example, the Arduino-based controller for your copter-levitated arm has three sequences: two sequences of samples (the analog inputs from the propellor-motor and angle-sensor) and a sequence of outputs (the analog output to the motor driver transistor).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use, and translate between, three representations for sequences: explicit enumeration, closed-form expression, and implicit definition using difference equations and initial conditions. (Difference equations are a special case of the recurrances commonly studied in discrete mathematics.) As an example, let [Math Processing Error] be the sequence of powers of \\frac{1}{2}. The sequence can be represented by explicit enumeration\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\{ ~ y[0] = 1, y[1] = \\frac{1}{2}, y[2] = \\frac{1}{4}, ...\\}$$ ,\n",
    "(3.1)\n",
    "or by closed-form expression,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y[n] = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^ n, \\; \\; \\; n \\ge 0,$$\n",
    "(3.2)\n",
    "or with a difference equation and an initial condition,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y[n] = \\frac{1}{2} y[n-1] , \\; \\; y[0] = 1$$ .\n",
    "(3.3)\n",
    "Note that we have chosen one of the standard notations for indicating sequence values, though our choice is far from universal. Throughout this course we will use the notation that indices for sequence values appear inside a pair of brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it can be clearer to graph short explicitly-enumerated sequences using â€œlollypop\" or stem plots. For example, below is a stem plot (created using MATLAB) for 200 samples of a sequence generated by roughly twenty milliseconds of a sound sampled eight thousand times a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 52: Stem plot of 200 samples of a sound (roughly 20 milliseconds)\n",
    "As must be obvious from the plot, stem plots can be cumbersome for long explicitly-enumerated sequences. They are not used, for example, in the software that plots real-time results from the copter-levitated arm."
