    "Linear Difference Equations LDEs vertical\n",
    " Marcar esta p√°gina\n",
    "As noted above, sequences can be represented implicitly, where an equation is given that relates one element of a sequence to other elements. For example, the elements of a power sequence satisfy\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y[n] = \\alpha _1 y[n-1] \\; \\; or\\; \\;  y[n] - \\alpha _1 y[n-1] = 0$$\t(3.4)\n",
    "Implicit representations of the above form are referred to homogenous first-order linear difference equations (LDEs): difference equation because we are computing differences between sequence values, linear because we are using linearly scaled sequence values, first-order because only one difference is being computed, and homogenous because the difference equation is equivalent to insisting that a particular weighted combination of adjacent sequence values must sum to zero (as shown above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a first-order LDE does not completely specify a sequence, one must also specify the value of y[n] for one value of n. If one specifies y[0], as is most common, then y[0] is referred to as an initial condition for the first-order LDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if y[0] = 5 and $\\alpha _1 = \\frac{1}{2}$ then the solution to the homogenous first-order LDE is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y[n] = 5 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$$^ n,\n",
    "(3.5)\n",
    "but if y[0] = 3, then the solution to the same LDE is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y[n] = 3 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$$^ n.\n",
    "(3.6)\n",
    "Another well-know sequence with a homogenous LDE representation is the Fibonacci sequence, in which the next element in the sequence is the sum of the previous two. That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y[n] = y[n-1] + y[n-2] \\; \\; \\; or \\; \\; \\; y[n] - y[n-1] - y[n-2] = 0$$.\n",
    "(3.7)\n",
    "The LDE for the Fibonacci sequence has two differences, so we refer to its associated LDE as second-order. And to completely specify the sequence generated by a second-order LDE, it is necessary to provide two initial values. To generate the classical Fibonacci numbers, set y[0] = 0 and y[1] = 1. Then, using the LDE, it is easy to explicitly enumerate the rest of the sequence values,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\{ y[2] = 1, y[3] = 2, y[4] = 3, ... \\}$$ .\n",
    "(3.8)\n",
    "In general, an LDE, together with initial conditions, defines an infinite sequence of values, y[0], y[1], y[2], \\ldots. We say an LDE is kth order when y[n] depends only on the k previous values of the sequence y. That is, a kth order homogenous LDE has the general form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y[n] = \\alpha _1 y[n-1] + \\alpha _2 y[n-2] + \\ldots , + \\alpha _ k y[n-k] = \\sum _{i=1}^{i=k} \\alpha _ i y[n-i]$$,\n",
    "(3.9)\n",
    "where \\alpha _1, \\ldots , \\alpha _ k are LDE-specific constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above LDE is referred to as homogenous because we can rewrite the equation as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y[n] - \\alpha _1 y[n-1] - \\alpha _2 y[n-2] - \\ldots , - \\alpha _ k y[n-k] = y[n] - \\sum _{i=1}^{i=k} \\alpha _ i y[n-i] = 0$$.\n",
    "(3.10)\n",
    "This rewrite means the LDE can be interpreted as requiring that a particular weighted combination of adjacent sequence values sum to zero, and therefore the sequence of all zeros will always satisfy the LDE (but not necessarily the initial conditions). Or said another way, homogeneity means that if y[n-1], y[n-2], \\dots y[n-k] are zero, then so it y[n]. When we add inputs, later, they will replace the zero on the right side of the rewritten homogenous LDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see below, it is easy to solve and reason about systems described by LDEs. So even though most systems are not precisely linear, we often model them with LDEs even if the model is not an exact fit. An easily analyzed, but imperfect, LDE model is likely to be more helpful in design than an accurate non-linear model that is nearly impossible to analyze.\n",
